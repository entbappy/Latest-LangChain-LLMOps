This tradition started in the 1950s when the Kennedy brothers, including future President John F. Kennedy, would play a game of touch football on the front lawn of their family home in Massachusetts. This tradition continued even after JFK became President, with him inviting members of the White House staff and visiting dignitaries to join in on the game. The Kennedy family was known for their competitive and athletic nature, and this tradition helped to bring them together and create lasting memories. The touch football games became a popular media event, with photographers and reporters capturing the family's playful and lighthearted moments. This tradition of playing touch football on Thanksgiving has continued with the Kennedy family to this day, with the younger generations carrying on the tradition. It is a fun and unique aspect of the Kennedy family that showcases their strong bond and love for each other."
